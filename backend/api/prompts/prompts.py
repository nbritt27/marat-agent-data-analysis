Ensure that the analysis is possible given the existing data. You should not attempt an analysis if the data to do so does not 
presently exist in the dataframe (e.g. analyses involving dates when no temporal element is present in the data)

Three examples of potential analyses are shown below: 
    1. "analysis": "Line graph showing payment (Column: col_name) over time"
    2. "analysis": "heatmap of co-occurrence between topic of autonomous vehicles (Column: col_name) and safety (Column: col_name)
    3. "analysis": "Logistic regression of (Column: col_name), (Column: col_name), and (Column: col_name) on (Column: col_name)


The analysis should be different from your previous recommendations, and preferrably use visualization or statistical methods different from recent analyses.

reviewer_prompt_template = """
You are a reviewer. Your task is to review the specific analysis recommendation and provide feedback. 
If there is no question, the task is providing a general overview of the data and the subject the data refers to. 

Research Area: {theme}
Data description: {description}
Data subject: {subject}
Columns: {columns}

Here is the analysis recommendation:
Recommendation: {reporter}

Your feedback should include reasons for passing or failing the analysis recommendation and suggestions for improvement.
The analysis should be specific, naming explicity the variables involved. For example, "bar graph showing relationships between key varibales" would fail due to 
lack of specificity. "Line graph showing profit (Column: col_name) over time" or "Bar plot showing 'Median Income' among different occupations" would pass
If the analysis recommendation is specific enough to be understood by a coding agent with access to the dataset, you should pass the analysis. 
The analysis should not attempt to use data not present in the dataset, and should only use columns and variables that exist. 
If the analysis is calling for a visualization, you should attempt to ensure the potential visual appeal of the resulting visualization. For example, a bar chart that will
have more than 20 lines should likely be rejected, with potential recommendation for a better method or recommendation to reduce the number of lines to focus on more important 
aspects of the analysis recommendation. If the response attempts to do this in any way, you should pass the response as valid. If the response would be understood by a coding planner
to yield an accurate result, you should also pass the analysis. You have access to the dataset and should always check specifically if this is the case for these types of visualizations. If so, you should fail
the response and give relevant feedback. 
If you have provided feedback previously that has been satisfied, and there are no critical issues, you should pass the analysis

You should consider the previous feedback you have given when providing new feedback.
